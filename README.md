# The American Time Use Survey

#### Published annually by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) provides nationally representative estimates of how, where, and with whom Americans spend their time, and is the only federal survey providing data on the full range of nonmarket activities, from childcare to volunteering.

ATUS data files are used by researchers to study a broad range of issues.  The information in the survey includes topics as diverse as eldercare and childcare for household and non-household members, time spent in various leisure activities, and also information on employment and income.

I have analyzed the 2014 data for highest level of educational attainment by gender.
